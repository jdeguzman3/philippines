			It's May 10, 2017 getting ready for my flight to the Philippines to attend the funeral of my late grandfather who passed away two days ago. It's heartbreaking news, and also something that I want to focus my attention on. Yet what I didn't realize is the experience that I would receive in my two week stay in the country where my parents childhood blossomed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first few days was the viewing, my last goodbye and a nights full of tears. As time gradually passed, it was more about adapting to the harsh heat that a canadian born filipino couldn't resist complaining about. Over time, I learned about the importance of family, and the happiness the people of the Philippines value. For them, just enjoying each other's company, sharing food, singing karaoke songs and even just smiling is very precious. It's a juxtaposition to what I thought of their lives; miserable and poor, pathetic and begging for any hope they can cling unto. While it's true that there are people like that in that country, the people who I was with weren't sad at all. Maybe they were indeed hiding their problems, but at least for the time I spent with them, I was genuinely impressed about how despite their circumstances, they do not let their circumstances define their happiness.

			I loved how cheap the food and accessories is in the Philippines. I enjoyed seeing different gifts that I could bring back home once my trip is over. I also enjoyed trying different food from restaurants and I guess... maybe some home food? Strictly speaking about food, I loved it. The circumstances around food... haha, not so much.
		</p>
		<p>
			What really amazed me was an entire body of water covered in sand. Supposedly, the place I went to had an active volcano that erupted a few years back, which subsequently turned into a sandy road for drivers to get from the streets to the island. I can't justify how breath taking the scenery was, nor can the picture I took from my iPhone5c take the entire beauty of it. Perhaps I'm overly hyped by it since it was my first time outside of Canada (save the U.S.), but imagine a landscape that's so wide it frees your mind from the stress you had for just a second... That was me.

			I've enjoyed palengkes (stores) and refreshing haircuts for cheap. I had the honor to visit INC Central and see the Philippino stadium. I enjoyed the motorcycle rides from my family and enjoy their company in a karaoke box. I somehow wished I knew some tagalog so I could enjoy the experience more in my trip, though at the time, my focus was indeed remembering about my late grandfather. I want to cherish this experience for the rest of my life.
