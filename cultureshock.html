			Nooooooooooope, I want to go home. Forget this! That was the train of thought running in my mind the moment I step foot out of the airport. My aunt was trying to guide me from the airport to our car, and tried to signal the driver to stop since it's the pedestrians' right of way (also marked on the road!). However, the driver ignored us and drove right in front of us as we were about to cross. This was unbearable, on top of the overbearing heat this late at night! This was the horrible experience I've been greeted with for the first few hours on my arrival. I thought that'd be the extent of it when I entered the vehicle on the way to my new temporary residence, but the world likes to prove me wrong. As our driver continued down the road, the markings on it would show 3 paths towards the gate booth. I don't know why, or how, or where common sense was born, but somehow we managed to make 5 or 6 car alleys heading towards 3 gate booths! Cutting cars to pass is like getting out of a full crowded bus, except you can't hit other cars else you'd get fined. First night, three complaints.

			Food was one of the greatest joys I had during my stay, but also a great headache. Since food was very cheap, I'd get to order quite a bit for myself, which in turn led me straight to the CR (comfort room, washroom). To my great dismay, they had no toilet paper! (pre-COVID) In the restaurant, there was an empty bucket with no water. Dumbstruck, just did what I had to do and stood up. At that moment, I realized why my family called me "tall". I was of average height for a canadian, but here, I could see the neighbouring stall without effort. Thank goodness it was empty. Apparently, the restaurant wasn't the only one without toilet paper, some of them even require you to pay 5 pesos for the amenities. The giant mall that I went to which had 6 floors only had 3 washroom stalls for the entire mall! And no toilet paper! I don't know if I regret eating 11 halo-halo (a filipino dessert) in my 14 day stay. Be warned, bring toilet paper with you if you do visit the Philippines.

			Home food was something I was weary about. I had this mentality that if food was served in a restaurant, it was meant to be edible and appealing to foreigners. The Philippines however, was a country full of resourceful people. That meant they had to be tolerant or used to certain things in life, or they enjoy different things altogether. Since I was a sheltered person growing up, I didn't have the need to adapt to changing situations. I would eat the food that resembled closer to home more eagerly, and stay away from the others that personally, I couldn't envision stomaching. I guess somehow that may have offended my family, and it was something I had to change during my stay. (It was my first experience out of Canada, cut me some slack haha.)

			I think the greatest shock for me was the scare. I'm not talking about jump scares, though I would've categorized it as one. I've seen youth laying on the street all covered in dirt, or beggars in the middle of palengkes. (stores, though in this case more of a flea market) The more I stood out, the more attraction I'd get: it wasn't the good kind. It hurt, since comparing myself to other people I'm blessed. I'd gone nuts if I wasn't near my cousins who would be there to help me talking to the others in tagalog that we have nothing. Despite being born from two filipino parents, I stood out as prey. Not only outside, but inside malls people would be friendlier and ask for more money and provide greater service. They would adapt to my situation by talking in English, and that honestly scared me since I couldn't discern whether they were being sincere or otherwise.

			My experience may seem irrelevant, but even within countries, there are different work cultures that I must learn how to adapt to. I'm grateful for the experience I've received, and would like to be able to partake once more after I become more successful in life.
